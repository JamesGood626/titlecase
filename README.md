# bootstrap-title-case

### What's it gonna do?

Today we're going to be making a bootstrap-layouted app that does two things:

1. Changes the text that someone enters into title case. What is title case? In some definitions--and definitely for our purposes--it means that the first letter of every word is capitalized. This means you're going to have to loop over what the user writes and do... something with certain letters. 

2. Takes a _second, different_ user input, and does... something... cool with it? Something _so cool_. It's up to you what that is! Go wild! Get down with your bad self.

So that's what it _does_. But!

### What's it gonna look like?

Your app should have AT LEAST two layouts, a mobile layout and a desktop layout. These layouts will be managed _with Bootstrap_. You may have to look up how to get Bootstrap's css into your page!

The mobile layout can look however you want; the desktop layout should have a header, a footer, and at least four (more if you want to!) content sections:

1. The input area for Title Case.
2. A results area for Title Case.
3. The input area for Something Cool Of Your Choice.
4. The input area for Something Cool Of Your Choice.

What goes on in your header and footer is your choice, as long as you have your name and a picture of some kind.

Let me know what questions you have, and I'll amend this document as needed!
